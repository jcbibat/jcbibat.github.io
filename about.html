				<h1>This is US!</h1>
				<p>Hey! We're Cognizance! We were established in the year of our lord 2017 on that faithful month of September (or August?) I don't know I kinda forgot. Anyway, we are a club that stands for awareness of controversial topics and fervent arguments over said topics. We like to argue (or maybe not?) lately our meetings have been kind of dying down, but trust that it was (kind of?) crazy at the beginning especially because of the acid baby thing. The point I am trying to convey that Cognizance is actually pretty fun to watch (or participate in) just because it is people arguing for what the believe in. In short, it is speech and debate without the commitment and the competitions.</p>
				<h1>Join US!</h1>
				<p>Hey! We're Cognizance! We meet every Friday at lunch in Mr. Carpenter's room which is in the C building. I would like to tell you the specific room number, but I don't know it and I don't feel like checking my schedule to find out, so like I'll just describe it's location to you. You know how there are 2 entrance ways to the C building, right? Well, you go through the door closest to the boys bathroom in the C building and it should be the second door to the left I think. If you see a person named Mr. Carpenter somewhere there you know you're at the right place. Better yet, if you have trouble just shout "CARPENTER!" in the hallways or something. Also, do not confuse him with the carpenter that wants an apprentice who was advertising in the bulletin, TOTALLY different guy.</p>

				<h2> This a demonstration of the use of a sidebar! </h2>
				<p> Sidebar: In the United States, the sidebar is an area in a courtroom near the judge's bench where lawyers may be called to speak with the judge so that the jury cannot hear the conversation and/or they may speak off the record. Lawyers make a formal request by stating "may I approach the bench?" or, simply "may I approach?" to initiate a sidebar conference. If it is granted, then opposing counsel must be allowed to come forward and participate in the conversation. BE COGNIZANT.</p>
